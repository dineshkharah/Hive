      Into the Wild tells the true story of the journey of 24-year-old
      Christopher McCandless into Alaskaâ€™s Denali National Park and Preserve,
      where he starved to death in an abandoned bus after spending four months
      foraging and hunting game. Intelligent but burdened by anger at his
      brilliant but overbearing and imperfect father, McCandless went entirely
      without human contact for four months in an attempt to purify himself of
      what he felt were the evils of civilization.
